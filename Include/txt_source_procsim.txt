      <h2 id="headerstr"> About Proc Simulator: </h2>
        <p id="infotext"> I started this project for myself. <br>
           This application sets two sets of items with their own properties against each other, <br>
      	   calculating the odds and returning which ones did and did not proc. <br><br>

    	   Short for 'Programmed Random Occurence', <br>
     	   'proc' refers to the triggering of effects, whether the occurence is random or not. <br>
      	   When these effects trigger or 'process', they are said to 'proc'. <br>
     	   The rate of occurence for random effects is termed the 'Proc Rate'. This is what my program intends to simulate.
