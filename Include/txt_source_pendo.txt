	   I had to make a page about one of my favourite music groups, therefore I chose Pendulum. <br>
   	   Using a database, you can leave comments and read the articles that are stored. <br>

    	   Like most of my sites, there are a bunch of references. <br>
	   For instance, the song in the background changes based on the weekday. <br>
	   I tried really hard to capture and match the 'Pendulum' style. <br><br>
	   Personally, I believe I succeeded. <br><br>
