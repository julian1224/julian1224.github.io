<h2 id="headerstr"> About MuseMe </h2>
  <p id="infotext"> This is a school project. <br>
     This webapp is meant to be a music list, <br>
     sorting music in a massive table that can be sorted. <br><br>
     The 'innovation' in this project is that the table contains stuff like <br>
     title, artist(s), album, year of release and mood. <br>
     Mood? Yes, mood. MuseMe helps you find music you <i>feel</i> like listening to.<br>
     The main reason I am making this is because it is something I would use. <br>
     WIP.
