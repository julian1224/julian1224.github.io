    <p id="infotext"> This is a school project.
     This webapp is meant to be a music list,
     sorting music in a massive table that can be sorted. <br><br>
     The 'innovation' in this project is that the table contains stuff like
     title, artist(s), album, year of release and mood.
     Mood? Yes, mood. MuseMe helps you find music you <i>feel</i> like listening to.
     The main reason I am making this is because it is something I would use.
     WIP.
