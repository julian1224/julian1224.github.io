        <p id="infotext"> This is me. I am Link. <br><br>
            I aspire to work hard writing code in PHP or JS. <br>
            As a creative person, I spend a lot of time listening to music and drawing art. <br><br>

            I like to code in Javascript because it doesn't require an internet connection. <br>
            The stuff I make are more applications than anything else because of this. <br>
            It doesn't mean, however, that I can't write PHP. <br><br>
            I am a big fan of colours and references. <br>
            You will find plenty of both in my work. <br><br>
