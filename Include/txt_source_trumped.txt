        <p id="infotext"> I built this wall. <br><br>
           This project is called the Wall because it is similar to a wall on social media. <br>
	   You can leave a comment with a name, description and an uploaded image.
	   The content is not moderated. I have to manually remove entries from the database. <br>
	   Still, it is functional and some efforts have been made to make uploading safer. <br>
	   However, there is no login. <br><br>

	   This site also has many references.<br>
	   Most of them are tied to search inputs. <br>
	   Be sure to try out the sorting.
