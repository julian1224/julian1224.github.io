     This project is called the Wall because it is similar to a wall on social media. <br>
     You can leave a comment with a name, description and an uploaded image.
     The content is not moderated. I have to manually remove entries from the database. <br>
     Still, it is functional and some efforts have been made to make uploading safer. <br>
     However, there is no login. <br><br>

     This site also has many references.<br>
     Most of them are tied to search inputs. <br>
     Be sure to try out the sorting. <br><br>
