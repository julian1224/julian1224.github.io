<h2 id="headerstr"> About the parallax demo </h2>
  <p id="infotext"> A simple scrolling animation. <br><br>
     I decided to include this on portfolio because I am very <br>
     pleased by how simple and yet so pleasing it is. <br>
     I will definitely be using this again some time. <br> <br>

     Honestly, the best way to explain is to look for yourself. <br> 
     Don't mind the stock images I used. <br><br>
